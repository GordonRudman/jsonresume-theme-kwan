# Kwan Theme 

This is a fork from the [Kwan Theme](https://github.com/icoloma/jsonresume-theme-kwan), modified to have similar date calculations to LinkedIn, so that the data stays consistent.

### To develop your resume

To develop iteratively (either to modify the template, CSS or resume contents) to the following

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant.git
$ cd jsonresume-theme-elegant
$ npm install
$ grunt watch // watches for less file changes
$ ./serve.js [optional_resume_filename] // Do this in a separate terminal to run the server with the provided resume or a default one
```

Visit [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to see the theme in action.
